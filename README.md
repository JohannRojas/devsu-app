This is a [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

### This App was developed for Devsu Interview ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

>**Note**: This app was created with de following sources:
>-   node v20.9.0 using fnm as node version manager
>-   npm v10.1.0
>-   xcode 15.0.1 (15A507)
>-   Android Studio Giraffe | 2022.3.1 Patch 3
Build #AI-223.8836.35.2231.11005911, built on October 25, 2023
Runtime version: 17.0.6+0-17.0.6b829.9-10027231 aarch64

## Step 1: Install your dependencies

First Install your dependencies from node


```bash
# using npm
npm install

# OR using Yarn
yarn add
```

### Don't forget run
```bash
npx pod-install
```

## Step 2: Launch the Metro server

after you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 3: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

>**Note**: If you need add whis command to package.json replacing --simulator for your device id >
```bash
"start:ios": react-native run-ios -- --simulator='iPhone 15 Pro Max (6A7F7E00-8AB8-4700-B87C-13D49C303044)'"
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run the React Native App for DEVSU. :partying_face:
